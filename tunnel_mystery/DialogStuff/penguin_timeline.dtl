	Spencer: Hey man. You want a drink?
	- No, but I do want information. You see anything suspicious recently?
		Spencer: Suspicious? I wouldn't say that. It's been a little slow today though, usually the front of the train buys more drinks, but it seems like they've been drinking less today.
		Spencer: Good luck with your investigation detective.
	- No,  just passing through.
		Spencer: Alright. Enjoy your ride sir.
